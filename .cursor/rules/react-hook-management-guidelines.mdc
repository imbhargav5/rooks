A hook must be export by name.

It should have corresponding test cases.

When ran in the terminal with pnpm test-hooks hookName eg `pnpm test-hooks useWillUnmount`, all the tests should pass.

Once a hook is ready to be tested, you should ask me whether I want to run tests in the terminal, if I confirm, you run this command and check what happens. 

Location of tests. This project is a mono repo, with rooks being the main package. The hooks are present in the src/hooks folder of the package. The tests are present in src/__tests__ folder of the rooks package. The rooks package is in the packages folder. 

See [useClipboard.ts](mdc:packages/rooks/src/hooks/useClipboard.ts) to understand how we write hooks.
See [useClipboard.spec.tsx](mdc:packages/rooks/src/__tests__/useClipboard.spec.tsx) for inspiration on how to write tests for a hook. 


If you ask me for confirmation for writing tests and I tell you to write tests, then you should first check if the file exists, and prompt me to confirm file creation. And then continue.
If there are errors, you either fix the test cases, or ask if I want to edit the hook source. 

Write fully typesafe code. Writing any / unknown is not allowed. Only in test cases mocking situations, you can use any/unknown, but only if there is no better option.
